#### *Where Cooking Meets Gamification & AI*

## üåü Introduction
Flavour Foundry is a gamified recipe platform that transforms cooking into an engaging, community-driven experience with real earning potential. Unlike traditional recipe sites, it rewards users with EXP points and credits for every interaction - uploading recipes, trying others' creations, leaving reviews, and ranking on weekly leaderboards. Users progress through four tiers (Bronze to Diamond), unlocking special abilities like recipe gatekeeping (restricting access by tier), credit-to-cash conversions via Stripe, and full recipe privatisation.

The platform combines culinary exploration with cutting-edge technology. Its AI integration (powered by Gemini) automatically estimates dish calories from images/ingredients and tracks nutritional trends. Built with Angular and Spring Boot, the system uses MongoDB for recipes, MySQL for user data, and Redis for leaderboard caching. Security features include JWT authentication and Google OAuth login.

What sets Flavour Foundry apart is its dual focus on community and monetisation. Users don't just share recipes - they build culinary reputations, earn passive income from popular recipes, and compete for top spots in the experience-based ranking system. The tiered structure creates compelling progression, where achieving Silver tier (Level 10) unlocks money-making opportunities, while Diamond status (Level 30) grants exclusive content control. Additional features like Ethereum donations and subscription plans further enhance earning potential, making this a unique hybrid of cooking platform and side-hustle ecosystem.
